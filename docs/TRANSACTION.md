# Doctor Appointment Backend - Transactions Guide

This guide outlines **when and where to use database transactions** in the Doctor Appointment Backend project to ensure data consistency and integrity.

---

## **1. User Signup (`/auth/register`)**

- **Operations:**
  1. Insert a new user.
  2. (Optional) Insert a welcome notification.
- **Transaction needed?**
  - ✅ Optional
- **Why:**  
  If you add related records (notifications, default settings), wrap them in a transaction to ensure the user is only created if all operations succeed.

---

## **2. Create Provider (`/providers`)**

- **Operations:**
  1. Insert a provider record.
  2. Optionally create default availability slots.
  3. Possibly trigger notifications.
- **Transaction needed?**
  - ✅ Yes
- **Why:**  
  You want all related steps to succeed or fail together. If slot creation fails, rollback provider creation.

---

## **3. Add Service (`/providers/{id}/services`)**

- **Operations:**
  1. Insert a service for a provider.
- **Transaction needed?**
  - ⚠️ Optional
- **Why:**  
  Single insert; only necessary if adding multiple related records simultaneously.

---

## **4. Set Availability (`/providers/{id}/availability`)**

- **Operations:**
  1. Insert multiple availability slots.
- **Transaction needed?**
  - ✅ Yes (if inserting multiple slots at once)
- **Why:**  
  Prevent partial insertion if one slot fails.

---

## **5. Create Booking (`/bookings`)**

- **Operations:**
  1. Check availability.
  2. Insert booking.
  3. Update slot availability (if using counters).
  4. Trigger notifications.
- **Transaction needed?**
  - ✅ Absolutely
- **Why:**  
  Prevent double bookings and ensure booking + notifications are consistent.

---

## **6. Cancel Booking (`/bookings/{id}/cancel`)**

- **Operations:**
  1. Update booking status.
  2. Refund (if implemented).
  3. Send notifications.
- **Transaction needed?**
  - ✅ Yes
- **Why:**  
  Ensures booking cancellation + refund + notification succeed together.

---

## **7. Payments (Optional)**

- **Operations:**
  1. Deduct payment / process Stripe/PayPal.
  2. Update booking/payment status.
  3. Send confirmation.
- **Transaction needed?**
  - ✅ Yes
- **Why:**  
  Only confirm the booking if payment succeeds.

---

## **General Guidelines**

1. **Single insert/update:** usually no need for transaction.
2. **Multiple related operations:** use transactions to ensure atomicity.
3. **Critical flows:** booking, provider creation, payments, cancellations should always use transactions.
